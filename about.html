                <p ><strong>Hi I am John Doe, photographer.</strong>Thank you for taking a little time to watch my art.
                I find myself becoming more and more jaded with the photographic landscape of today. 
                I never want to be someone who takes predictable, boring photographs. To combat this, 
                I ask myself after every photo: is this good enough for a gallery, a museum, a photo book? If so, I’m happy.
                I’m always looking to create timeless images; classic photographs. I made a solo gallery and cooporated with different of photographers the last 7 years.
                I like to make every situation more artistic, so everyone who sees the photos would think that it was taken out of a movie. If you are interested in a colaboration
                or a photoshoot or just want to hang around in these magical experience go to the contact section and send us a message. 
                </p>
                <p>Thank you,I hope to colaborate with you soon. </p>
